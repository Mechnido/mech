  <h5>Dr.Thavamani D. Palaniswami - <span>Secretary</span></h5>
            <p>India is a unique nation that can boast of having one of the largest youth population in the world. A nation's wealth and strength are its youth and on those terms India is rich and strong. How the strength and skills of the youth are channelized is of great importance. The youngsters of today are at an advantage because they live in an era of great development especially in the areas of science and technology.</p>
            <p>The scope and application of technical education is an issue of primary importance. In an age when most things can he engineered, educators need to give thought to the outcome of the finished product. In other words 'The Student'. Thus an institution needs to be engineered to meet the expectations of several - that of the student, the parents, the industry into which the candidate will be absorbed, and finally the society worldwide.</p>
            <p>This institution, Dr. N.G.P Institute of Technology which was formally established in September 2007 was set up with a determination of playing a very distinct role in shaping the destinies of the students who will be able to meet the requirements of a demanding and competitive world.</p>
            <p>In order to forge the foundation and improve our human capital both qualitatively and quantitatively, appropriate educational training is offered by us to cover the entire spectrum of leaning. Since knowledge is the growth-driver in today's globalized world, we uphold the highest standards when imparting knowledge and integrating generic skills. This we achieve through our highly dedicated team of teaching staff, technical staff, administrative staff and non-teaching staff. Students these days not only need Practice skills but also need to be equipped to stand out among others. It is that cutting-edge quality that we tirelessly strive to maintain.</p>
            <p>Studies alone do not help mould one's character. It is the institution, its location, its facilities and ambience that aid in the overall character development of a student. In our institution we emphasize on integrity and cultural sensitivity. Here, we shape an individual's ethical values. We do our sincere part in contributing to the evolution of National building. To know and experience this one needs to be a part of this Institution.</p>
